ElementConfiguration is both a program written in Java, and as a webpage. By only having a data sheet with the element name, abbreviation,
and atomic number, it is able to create 3 types of electronic configurations and create an orbital diagram for it.

87% of the web development portion of this project was written in Javascript, while the other HTML/CSS. The Java was the base of this project,
before the logic was rewritten in Javascript to be used on the web.

The web project requires Bootstrap 4, and JQuery. Both of them are already used with third party sources in the code.
